# Summary
This repository contains the Hydra training modules and assignments.
It's aimed at Adaptive's backend developers who want to learn about Hydra. It 
assumes no prior trading system experience, and each module can be taken independently, but 
they build up on the previous modules cumulatively, so it might be necessary to understand
concepts from a previous module (all previous modules are prerequisites for the current one).

# Manila backend developers
### Timeframe
For Manila office new hires, training will be 3-4 weeks full-time before people join projects. 
The first week will mostly be taken up by initial Adaptive and Hydra training.  

### Process
New back-end developers will be given access to the training material and assignments to work through independently, through the https://github.com/AdaptiveConsulting/academy-guides repository.

People may join at different times, so everyone will consume the material independently.

They will have access to:
- Local support from Phil Sales and other back-end developers who have already done the training / joined projects.
- Hydra documentation
- A dedicated training Slack channel where they can ask questions.
- The #hydra Slack channel.
- Daily check-ins/standups, as well as Code reviews / Q&A sessions (early morning UK time). The Academy team can initially help fill this gap, longer-term this should probably fall to the relevant offices or practices.

### Schedule
- Week 1
     - Modules 1, 2 and 3
     - Assignments 1, 2 and 3

- Week 2
     - Modules 4, 5 and 6
     - Assignments 4 and 5

- Week 3
    - Modules 7, 8 and 9
    - Assignment 5

# Contributors to this repository
It's of crucial importance to not cover multiple concepts at once, but iteratively introducing new concepts.

### Training Modules
These training modules are based on the [Hydra Platform Training Syllabus](https://weareadaptive.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/HYDRA/pages/4037050457/Hydra+Platform+Training+Syllabus).

Training modules will combine information from (and call out where necessary to) 
- [Hydra documentation](https://docs.hydra.weareadaptive.com/LATEST/Development/GettingStarted/HydraPlatformTutorial.html) 
- [Aeron Cookbook](https://aeroncookbook.com/) 
 
and Early Careers Programme training materials.

The Hydra Platform documentation is very comprehensive, and for many topics, training modules will be able to refer people to the relevant pages in the documentation. 
The training modules, however, in conjunction with the assignments, aim to provide an iterative learning path that can guide people in their learning.

The Academy can compile modules 1 to 6 from the existing Hydra documentation and Early Careers training material, and make it available to the Hydra platform core team for validation and review.

It would however be preferable for the content team who puts the material together to be trained directly on all relevant aspects by the Hydra platform team, to ensure it is in line with the knowledge they require people to have.

For modules 7 to 9, there are no training materials to draw on, only some documentation and the training material will need to be provided by the Hydra core team. They have therefore been left unchanged from what is in the Hydra training syllabus. The training modules on operation tooling and testing are very important for Manila specifically.

### Markdown

Documentation should be written in Markdown, here's a [useful cheatsheet](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/). Each module has its own folder,
and its own root markdown file that follows the conventione Module #.md, and there's an images subfolder where all images referenced in that module should be placed.

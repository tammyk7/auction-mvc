# Module 6 - Hydra Components

Goal: To embed knowledge about Hydra platform component usage

- Lifecycle events
- Threadsafe vs. non-threadsafe logging
- Bootstrapping components

## Assignments
We have covered a good part of Hydra functionality, it's time to put this knowledge into practice with some assignments:

- Assignment A: broadcasting events (the file [Assignment A.md](/Assignment%20A.md) has all the details)
- Assignment B: keeping a cache of users in the gateway (the file [Assignment B.md](/Assignment%20B.md) has all the details) and use it for validation checks in the gateway.

Each file has a corresponding folder under `code` (i.e. `code/assignment_a`) with some code provided, and in each
assignment it is expected that you write some code that fulfills some requirements.

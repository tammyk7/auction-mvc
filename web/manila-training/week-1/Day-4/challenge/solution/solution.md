#### Notes:
In this solution, we define a component called `MyForm` that uses the `useValidation` custom hook to manage the form state and validation logic. The `useValidation` hook takes a validation schema object as its only argument, which defines the validation rules for each input.

The `useValidation` hook returns four values: `inputs`, `errors`, `handleInputChange`, and `handleSubmit`. The `inputs` object contains the current values of the form inputs, the `errors` object contains any validation errors, the `handleInputChange` function is used to update the form inputs, and the `handleSubmit` function is used to submit the form.

The `MyForm` component renders a form with two input fields: a name field and an email field. The `handleInputChange` function is passed as a callback to the `onChange` event of each input, which allows the input values to be updated as the user types. The `errors` object is used to display any validation errors next to the input fields, and the `handleSubmit` function is called when the form is submitted.

If the form inputs are valid, the `handleSubmit` function logs the inputs in console and shown in a `window.alert` dialog box. If the form inputs are invalid, the `errors` object is updated with the validation errors, which causes the error messages to be displayed next to their respective input fields.

This `useValidation` hook takes a validation schema and an onSubmit callback function (optional) as its arguments, and returns an object with `inputs`, `errors`, `handleInputChange`, and `handleSubmit` properties.

The `inputs` property is an object that contains the current values of the form inputs. The `errors` property is an object that contains any validation errors.

The `handleInputChange` function is a callback function that updates the inputs object when the user types into the form input fields.

The `handleSubmit` function is a callback function that is called when the user submits the form. It first validates the form inputs according to the `validationSchema` object. If the form inputs are valid, the `onSubmit` callback function is called with the `inputs` object as its argument, and `inputs` and `errors` properties are reset.

# Observables vs. Signals vs. Subjects

In general, you would **use Subjects when you need to send values to multiple subscribers or create custom Observables**, and you would **use Signals when you need to handle events in a reactive manner and separate the producer and consumer of those events**.

**Observables** are a core concept of RxJS and represent a stream of values or events over time. They are used when you need to handle asynchronous or event-based data flows. Observables are particularly useful when you need to:

- Handle streams of values over time, such as user input events, API responses, or timer events.
- Compose, transform, or combine multiple streams of values.
- Handle complex asynchronous operations, such as retrying failed requests or debouncing user input.

**Signals** in `react-rxjs` are similar to Subjects in RxJS, but with a key difference: they split the producer and the consumer. This means that the code that emits values (the producer) is separated from the code that reacts to those values (the consumer). Signals are particularly useful when:

- You need to handle events in a reactive manner, such as user interactions or form submissions.
- You want to separate the producer and the consumer of events, which can make your code more declarative and easier to reason about.
- You need to share a single event source among multiple consumers.

In general, you would **use Observables when you need to handle, transform, or compose asynchronous data flows**, and you would **use Signals when you need to handle events in a reactive manner and separate the producer and consumer of those events**. It's also common to use Signals and Observables together in a `react-rxjs` application. For example, you might use a Signal to handle user interactions and then use an Observable to transform and react to those events.

**Subjects** are a type of Observable that can act as both a source of values and an observer that can subscribe to one or more Observables. They are particularly useful when you need to:

- Send values to multiple subscribers at the same time, such as when broadcasting events across different components.
- Create custom Observables that can be controlled from the outside, such as when you need to manually add or remove observers.

In `react-rxjs`, Subjects can be used in a similar way to Signals, but with some key differences. While Signals are designed to split the producer and consumer of events, Subjects allow for more flexibility in how you handle event streams.

When working with Subjects in `react-rxjs`, you may want to use a regular Subject instead of a Signal in certain cases. For example, if you have a simple event stream that doesn't require complex transformations or composition, a regular Subject can provide a simpler and more straightforward solution.

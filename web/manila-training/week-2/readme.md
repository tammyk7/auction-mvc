# Week 2: Introduction to Reactive Programming with RxJS and TypeScript

Welcome to your second week. This week, we will introduce you to the world of Reactive Programming with RxJS and TypeScript.

For this week, you will be going through a udemy course that covers the basics & handling of RxJS. You can find a link to the course [here](https://weareadaptive.udemy.com/course/rxjs-and-observables/?src=sac&kw=rxjs).

If you do not already have access to Adaptive's Udemy Account, please email helpdesk@weareadaptive.com. Ask to be given a business Udemy account and they should respond quickly.

> ðŸ’¡ We are working to include additional exercises to accompany this course. Please checkback soon as this is a living repo and it gets updated frequently. You will find some fragmented material in week 2 that may repeat topics covered in the Udemy course. Feel free to skim through. We have a coding challenge [here](week-2/Day-5/README.md) that will test your understanding of RxJS.

In addition to the Udemy course, please also take a look at the following video from Victor:

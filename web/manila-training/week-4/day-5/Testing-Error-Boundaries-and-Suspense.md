## Testing Error Boundaries and Suspense

Testing Error Boundaries and Suspense is no different than testing your react applications, the goal is to make sure the app is behaving as expected and rendering the correct UI to the user. Instead of reading more on these topics, we've added links to videos created by Kent Dodds. These videos were created in 2018 but do a great job at explaining the ways we can test Suspense and Error Boundaries. Kent uses the [Jest Testing Framework](https://jestjs.io/) and [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/) to test in these videos. We already covered the React Testing Library, but we haven't covered Jest. If you're not familiar with Jest that is okay, the syntax is almost identical to Vitest which we used for our integration test.

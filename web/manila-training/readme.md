# Welcome Devs!

We have put together a day-to-day material of topics (including but not limited to) tackling the projects you are going to work on. Please refer to the file structure covering each week, starting with `week-1`, and reading through the top-level markdown files as you traverse through each enclosing folder.

### How to Navigate the Material

While reading content is a great way to learn, it is recommended that you run each snippet provided yourself (as applicable). Break the examples, fix what you break. 

To get started we recommend that you have the latest npm - [Node Package Manager](https://nodejs.dev/en/download/) installed on your local machine.

To quickly spin up a new react app locally, you can create a new React Project template using Vite: 

- Run this -> `npm init vite@latest app-name-goes-here --template react-ts` script in your desired directory.

- Select React framework [options](./assets/options.png)

- Select JavaScript/TypeScript variant [JSTS](./assets/JSTS.png)

- Change directory onto the folder, install packages as instructed and you should be good to go!

# Welcome Devs!

We have put together a day-to-day material of topics (including but not limited to) tackling the projects you are going to work on. Please refer to the file structure covering each week, starting with `week-1`, and reading through the top-level markdown files as you traverse through each enclosing folder.

### How to Navigate the Material

While reading content is a great way to learn, it is recommended that you run each snippet provided yourself (as applicable). Break the examples, fix what you break.

To get started we recommend that you have the latest npm - [Node Package Manager](https://nodejs.dev/en/download/) installed on your local machine.

To quickly spin up a new react app locally, you can create a new React Project template using Vite:

- Run this -> `npm init vite@latest app-name-goes-here --template react-ts` script in your desired directory.

- Select React framework [options](./assets/options.png)

- Select JavaScript/TypeScript variant [JSTS](./assets/JSTS.png)

- Change directory onto the folder, install packages as instructed and you should be good to go!

#### Week 2: Introduction to RxJS
For this week, you will be going through a udemy course that covers the basics & handling of RxJS. You can find a link to the course [here](https://weareadaptive.udemy.com/course/rxjs-and-observables/?src=sac&kw=rxjs).

If you do not already have access to Adaptive's Udemy Account, please email helpdesk@weareadaptive.com. Ask to be given a business Udemy account and they should respond quickly.

> ðŸ’¡ We are working to include additional exercises to accompany this course. Please checkback soon as this is a living repo and it gets updated frequently. You will find some fragmented material in week 2 that may repeat topics covered in the Udemy course. Feel free to skim through. We have a coding challenge [here](week-2/Day-5/README.md) that will test your understanding of RxJS.

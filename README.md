# Adaptive Academy Guides
Welcome to the Adaptive Academy Guides Repo. Here you will find training materials covering both frontend and backend concepts.

> ðŸ’¡At the moment, this repository is a bit disorganized, but it is a work in progress. Our focus has mainly been to generate as many training materials as possible. Now, we are going back and restructuring the entire repository to make it more organized and consistent. Please stay tuned as things evolve.
## Web
Inside the "web" directory, you will find two subdirectories, but the main one to look at is the "manila training" folder. Here, you will find a four-week set of training materials that cover React, TypeScript, RxJS, and React-RxJS. Each week is broken down by the day.

For more information, and to learn how to get started with these materials please see: [manila-training/README.md](manila-training/README.md)

> ðŸ’¡ Note: Although the training materials in the directory mentioned above were initially designed for new hires in the Manila office, they are available to anyone looking to enhance their understanding of intermediate to advanced React concepts, as well as those seeking to learn how to use RxJS with React.

In addition to the Manila training materials, you will find several implementations of the Web Early Careers Stopwatch project under the directory "ecp-stopwatch".
## Java
Inside the "Java" directory, you will find the exercises and materials utilized by the Java Early Careers programme, as well as a new set of training modules being developed specifically around Hydra.
## Aeron
Inside the "Aeron" directory, you will find a tutorial that covers the main concepts needed to understand the Aeron library, as well as several in-depth implementations of the practice assignment.
